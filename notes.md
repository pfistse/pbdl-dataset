# TODOs for presentation
- [ ] dataset overview
- [ ] solver-in-the-loop normalization
- [ ] clean-up code


# TODOs
- [ ] partitioning independent of simulations
  - partition by file size; assume equal number of frames for every simulation
- [ ] website to showcase dataset
  - click on dataset to get starter code

# Presentation
